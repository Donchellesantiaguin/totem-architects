            <p>The Pemaky Villa is a single-family primary residence located at Riviera Golf in the Cocody municipality, near Sol Béni, the training centre of ASEC Mimosas. It benefits from a highly sought-after neighbourhood, currently under construction, where luxurious real estate projects coexist, several boasting the signature of renowned architects. The Pemaky Villa, with its modern and understated architecture, has chosen to respect this select neighbourhood without engaging in architectural exhibitionism.</p>
        	</div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>The house is organised around a central garden, visible from all living spaces and bedrooms, thanks to the large transparency of the interior façades. The ground floorincludes parking for 4 vehicles, a large living room, dining room, kitchen with adjoining service areas, and finally, the poolhouse adjacent to the pool, serving as a private reception area for the owner. The first floor, however, houses the bedrooms and family living room.</p>
				
			<p>A notable element in the architectural composition of this project is the walkway connecting the master bedroom to the family living room, which also serves as a suspended terrace for the latter.</p>
